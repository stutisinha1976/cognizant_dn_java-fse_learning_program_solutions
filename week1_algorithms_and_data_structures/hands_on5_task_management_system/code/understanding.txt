Singly Linked List
A data structure where each node has:

data

a reference (pointer) to the next node

Traversal is only possible forward.

Doubly Linked List
Each node has:

data

a next pointer and a previous pointer.

Allows both forward and backward traversal.

Why Use Linked Lists?
Arrays have fixed size and costly insertions/deletions.

Linked lists are dynamic and efficient at insert/delete, especially in the middle or beginning.
