1) How Arrays are Represented in Memory:
An array is a fixed-size collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.

Each element can be accessed in constant time using an index:

address = base_address + index * size_of_each_element

This layout allows fast access to any element.

2) Advantages of Arrays:
Fast random access – O(1) time to access any element by index.

Simple structure – Easy to use and implement.

Memory-efficient – No overhead for object references or pointers (compared to linked lists).
