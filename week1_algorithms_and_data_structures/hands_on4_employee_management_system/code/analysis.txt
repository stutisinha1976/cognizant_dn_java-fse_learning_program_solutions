 Step 4: Analysis of Time Complexity
Operation	            Time Complexity	                Explanation
Add	                    O(1)	                Appending at the end of array
Search	                O(n)	                Linear search (no indexing by ID)
Traverse	            O(n)	                One pass through all records
Delete	                O(n)	                Need to shift elements after deletion

Limitations of Arrays
Drawbacks:
Fixed Size: You must know in advance how many employees you'll have.

Costly Insert/Delete: Need to shift elements when deleting or inserting in between.

No Flexibility: Cannot dynamically grow unless you manually resize the array.

When to Use Arrays:
When the number of records is known and small.

When fast access by index is required.

When memory layout matters (e.g., for performance optimization).
