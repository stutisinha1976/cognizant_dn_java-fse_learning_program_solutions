Operation	            Linear Search	    Binary Search
Time Complexity	        O(n)	            O(log n)
Requires Sorting	    No	                Yes

Step 6: When to Use Each
Use linear search when the dataset is small or unsorted.

Use binary search when the dataset is large and already sorted, or can be sorted efficiently.
