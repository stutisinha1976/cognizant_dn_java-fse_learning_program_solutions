Step 1: Understand Search Algorithms
Linear Search
Definition: Iterates through each element in the list to find a match.

Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(1)

Worst Case: O(n)

Use Case: Useful for small or unsorted datasets.

Advantage: Works on both sorted and unsorted data.

Binary Search
Definition: Efficient search algorithm that works by repeatedly dividing a sorted list in half.

Time Complexity:

Best/Average/Worst Case: O(log n)

Use Case: Best for large, sorted datasets.

Limitation: The list must be sorted beforehand.
