1. Understand Asymptotic Notation
✅ What is Big O Notation?
Big O notation is like a mathematical way of describing how fast (or slow) your algorithm is, especially as the data grows.

It doesn’t give you exact timings, but rather how performance changes with more data.

Name	        Meaning	                    Example
O(1)	    Constant time (fastest)	    Accessing an array element
O(log n)	Logarithmic time	        Binary search
O(n)	    Linear time	                    Linear search
O(n log n)	Efficient sorting           (e.g., merge sort)	
O(n²)	    Nested loops (slow!)	

✅ Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios for Search
Search Type	        Best Case	                Average Case	       Worst Case
Linear Search	       O(1) (1st match) 	    O(n/2) → O(n)            O(n)
Binary Search	       O(1) (middle match)	    O(log n)	             O(log n)
