What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve a smaller part of the problem.

It works well for problems that can be broken into similar subproblems (divide-and-conquer approach).

Example Use Case:
In financial forecasting, recursion can help calculate future values based on a formula like:


FutureValue(n) = FutureValue(n-1) * (1 + growthRate)
