Algorithm	    Best Case	Average Case	Worst Case	Space	    Stable
Bubble Sort	    O(n)	        O(n²)	    O(n²)	    O(1)	    Yes
Quick Sort	    O(n log n)	    O(n log n)	O(n²)	O   (log n)	    No

📝 Why Quick Sort is Preferred Over Bubble Sort
Efficiency: Quick Sort is significantly faster for large datasets due to O(n log n) average complexity.

Practicality: Bubble Sort performs redundant comparisons and swaps, making it impractical for real applications.

Scalability: Quick Sort scales better with input size.
